## Work Experience
### Worked on traits of Drosophila
- **I have worked on experiments about quantitative traits , Polytene Chromosomes,
Different crosses between Drosophila melanogaster .There I had an extraordinary
opportunity to work under Dr Bodhisatta Nandy and Vineesh Shenoy , as a part of our
course. I was fortunate to embark on an enriching chance to know more about
Drosophila model system.**
  
  
### Worked on Cell culture Basics
- **I had an opportunity to work on experiments based on Cell culture basics like MTT
Assay , Immunofluorescence Assay instructed by Dr Selvi Bharathavikru and Dr
Swati Shree Padhi .There I had a great oppurtunity to visualize different cell types like
M15 and MDMB as a part of our 3rd year course.**


### Worked on SEC and DLS based experiments
- **Here I had an extraordinary opportunity to know more about SEC and DLS . This
helped me to know deeply about both these concepts . Also i had a great opportunity
to learn from DR Shanti Swaroop Srivastava as a part of my 3rd year lab course.**

## Workshops/Conferences
### Summer Webinar Series from LA VIDA (Biology club of IISER bpr

journey.During this webinar ,I recieved a comprehensive crash course on topics like
Cancer vaccines there confronting challenges in Design and Development,Left Right
patterning in mammalian embryos ,Formation of muscles and their maintainance in
the living system.** 
  
### Seminars conducted by DOB of IISER bpr 
- **I have engaged in the talk given by Dr Jiban Jyoti Panda and Dr Nitin Singhal on Nano
therapeutics and Reducing PCK-1 gene expression as a part of CSDAB
Programme.This talk helped me a lot to indulge more into beauty of Biological
Science.**
